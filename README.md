Run "make" to compile googletest(gtest) with our source code.

The "Makefile" gives an example of how you can use googletest. The idea is to include the gtest header files during compilation, and compile gtest_main.a with your own source code.

Note that this "Makefile" does not try to install gtest on your system. To install gtest systemwide, please refer to the README file of gtest directory.
